# LLM-ChatBot

## Introduction 
Welcome to DocumentChatBot, a chatbot that engages in conversations based on the content of the documents you upload. This project is built upon the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Architecture, serving as its backbone to provide a robust and dynamic conversational experience

## Architecture
DocumentChatBot is designed to facilitate conversations by analyzing and responding to the content of uploaded documents. The RAG Architecture employed in this project enhances the bot's ability to retrieve relevant information and generate coherent responses, resulting in an intelligent and context-aware conversational agent.
